        "final_response": "<FINAL_RESPONSE>\n### Introduction\nJupiter and Mars are two fascinating planets in our solar system, but they couldn't be more different. Jupiter is the largest planet, a gas giant often called the \"king of planets,\" while Mars is a smaller, rocky world known as the \"Red Planet\" due to its rusty surface. These differences stem from their formation, composition, and positions in the solar system.\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n- **Size and Mass**: Jupiter is massive\u2014about 11 times wider than Earth and 318 times more massive. It's so big that all other planets could fit inside it. Mars, in contrast, is roughly half Earth's size and only about 10% of Earth's mass, making it a terrestrial planet.\n- **Composition**: Jupiter is a gas giant, primarily made of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface\u2014it's like a swirling ball of clouds. Mars is rocky, with a thin crust, mantle, and core, featuring mountains, canyons, and volcanoes like Olympus Mons, the solar system's tallest.\n- **Atmosphere**: Jupiter's thick atmosphere creates colorful bands and massive storms, like the Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth that's raged for centuries. Mars has a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, leading to dusty winds and global dust storms, but it's too sparse to support liquid water on the surface.\n- **Moons**: Jupiter boasts over 90 moons, including large ones like Europa and Ganymede with potential subsurface oceans. Mars has just two small, potato-shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.\n\n### Orbital and Environmental Differences\n- **Distance from the Sun and Orbit**: Jupiter orbits about 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth (at 778 million km), taking 12 Earth years for one lap. Mars is closer, at 228 million km, orbiting in about 687 Earth days, which makes it easier to observe from Earth.\n- **Rotation and Temperature**: Jupiter spins rapidly (a day is just 10 hours), generating intense magnetic fields and auroras. Its temperatures plummet to -145\u00b0C in the clouds. Mars rotates similarly to Earth (24.6 hours), but its average temperature is a chilly -60\u00b0C, with polar ice caps of water and CO2.\n- **Exploration History**: Mars has been a prime target for rovers like Perseverance, searching for signs of ancient life. Jupiter's missions, like Juno, study its storms and moons, but its radiation makes landings impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe contrasts between Jupiter's colossal, stormy grandeur and Mars' barren, rugged terrain highlight the diversity of our solar system. Jupiter protects inner planets by gravitationally capturing asteroids, while Mars offers clues to potential habitability. Studying both expands our knowledge of planetary formation and the search for life beyond Earth.\n(Word count: 378)\n</FINAL_RESPONSE>",

This happens through a series of steps that convert human-readable code into machine-executable actions.\n\n1. **Writing the Code**: A programmer writes source code in a high-level language (like Python or Java), which is readable and logical for humans, using words and structures.\n\n2. **Translation Phase**: The code is processed by a compiler (for languages like C++) or interpreter (for languages like Python). A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code (binary instructions) ahead of time, creating an executable file. An interpreter translates and runs the code line by line in real-time.\n\n3. **Conversion to Binary**: The translator breaks down the code into low-level instructions, converting it into binary\u2014a series of 0s and 1s that represent operations like \"add\" or \"store data.\"\n\n4. **Loading into Memory**: The binary code is loaded into the computer's RAM (random access memory) by the operating system, preparing it for execution.\n\n5. **Execution by CPU**: The central processing unit (CPU) reads the binary instructions from memory, one by one, and carries them out\u2014performing calculations, accessing data, or controlling hardware.\n\n6. **Output and Interaction**: As instructions run, the computer produces results, like displaying text on screen or saving files, based on the code's logic.\n\nIn summary, computers understand code through translation and execution of binary instructions, turning abstract ideas into tangible actions\u2014making programming a bridge between human creativity and machine precision.\n</FINAL_RESPONSE>",

        "final_response": "<FINAL_RESPONSE>\n### SQL Tutorial for Beginners: DDL, DML, Data Types, Constraints, and Key Clauses\n\nHello! I'm your SQL tutor, here to guide you through the basics step by step. We'll use a simple \"Employees\" database as our example. Imagine a table tracking employee info: ID (unique employee number), Name (their full name), Salary (annual pay), and Department (e.g., Sales or IT). I'll explain each concept, show examples with table views (using markdown for clarity), and include practice questions with solutions. Let's dive in!\n\n#### 1. Data Types in SQL\nData types define what kind of data a column can hold, like numbers, text, or dates. They ensure data integrity and save storage space. Common ones:\n- **INT**: Whole numbers (e.g., employee ID).\n- **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length text up to n characters (e.g., names).\n- **DECIMAL(p,s)**: Precise decimals, p total digits, s after decimal (e.g., salary like 50000.00).\n- **DATE**: Dates (not covered deeply here, but useful for hire dates).\n\n**Example 1: Creating a table with data types.**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Employees (\n    ID INT,\n    Name VARCHAR(50),\n    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),\n    Department VARCHAR(20)\n);\n```\nResult: An empty table structure.\n| ID | Name | Salary | Department |\n|----|------|--------|------------|\n*(Empty)*\n\n**Example 2: Inserting data to see types in action.**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Employees VALUES (1, 'Alice Smith', 55000.50, 'Sales');\n```\nResult:\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 55000.50 | Sales      |\n\n*Analogy*: Data types are like labeled boxes\u2014put text in a VARCHAR box, numbers in INT, or it won't fit!\n\n**Practice Question 1:** What data type would you use for a column storing employee ages (whole numbers 18-65)? Create a new table \"Ages\" with an ID (INT) and Age column.\nSolution:\n- Explanation: Use INT for ages since they're whole numbers without decimals.\n- Query:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE TABLE Ages (\n      ID INT,\n      Age INT\n  );\n  ```\n- Result: Empty table with INT columns for precise integer storage.\n\n#### 2. DDL Commands (Data Definition Language)\nDDL commands define or modify database structures like tables. Focus: CREATE (make new), ALTER (change existing), DROP (delete).\n\n**Example 1: CREATE (Table Creation).**\nAs above, we created Employees. It sets up the blueprint.\n\n**Example 2: ALTER (Column Manipulation - Add/Modify/Drop Columns).**\nColumn-wise: Add a new column; row-wise isn't direct in ALTER but affects all rows.\nSQL Query (Add \"HireDate\" column):\n```sql\nALTER TABLE Employees ADD HireDate DATE;\n```\nBefore (from earlier insert):\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 55000.50 | Sales      |\n\nAfter:\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department | HireDate |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|----------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 55000.50 | Sales      | NULL     |\n\nSQL Query (Modify Salary precision):\n```sql\nALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY Salary DECIMAL(12,2);\n```\n(No visible change, but allows larger salaries.)\n\nSQL Query (Drop a column):\n```sql\nALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN HireDate;\n```\nBack to original structure.\n\n**Example 3: DROP (Table Deletion).**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nDROP TABLE Employees;\n```\nResult: Table gone\u2014data lost forever! (Use backups in real life.)\n\n*Analogy*: DDL is like building/renovating/demolishing a house\u2014CREATE builds, ALTER renovates rooms (columns), DROP tears it down.\n\n**Practice Question 2:** You have the Employees table. Add a \"Email\" column (VARCHAR(100)), then drop the Department column.\nSolution:\n- Explanation: ALTER adds/drops columns, affecting the table structure (column-wise manipulation).\n- Queries:\n  ```sql\n  ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Email VARCHAR(100);\n  ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN Department;\n  ```\n- Result (after add, before drop, assuming prior data):\n  | ID | Name       | Salary   | Department | Email     |\n  |----|------------|----------|------------|-----------|\n  | 1  | Alice Smith| 55000.50 | Sales      | NULL      |\n- After drop: Email column added, Department removed.\n\n#### 3. DML Commands (Data Manipulation Language)\nDML handles data inside tables: INSERT (add rows), UPDATE (change rows), DELETE (remove rows), SELECT (view data). Row-wise focus for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; column selection in SELECT.\n\n**Example 1: INSERT (Row Addition).**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary, Department) VALUES (2, 'Bob Johnson', 60000.00, 'IT');\nINSERT INTO Employees VALUES (3, 'Carol Lee', 45000.75, 'Sales');\n```\nResult:\n| ID | Name        | Salary    | Department |\n|----|-------------|-----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith | 55000.50  | Sales      |\n| 2  | Bob Johnson | 60000.00  | IT         |\n| 3  | Carol Lee   | 45000.75  | Sales      |\n\n**Example 2: UPDATE (Row/Column Changes).**\nRow-wise: Targets specific rows; affects columns in those rows.\nSQL Query (Update Alice's salary):\n```sql\nUPDATE Employees SET Salary = 58000.00 WHERE ID = 1;\n```\nBefore:\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 55000.50 | Sales      |\n| 2  | Bob Johnson| 60000.00 | IT         |\n\nAfter:\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 58000.00 | Sales      |\n| 2  | Bob Johnson| 60000.00 | IT         |\n\n**Example 3: DELETE (Row Removal).**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nDELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 3;\n```\nResult (removes Carol's row):\n| ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n|----|------------|----------|------------|\n| 1  | Alice Smith| 58000.00 | Sales      |\n| 2  | Bob Johnson| 60000.00 | IT         |\n\n**Example 4: SELECT (View Data - Basic Table Manipulation Query).**\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees;\n```\nShows the full table as above.\n\n*Analogy*: DML is like managing inventory\u2014INSERT stocks items (rows), UPDATE edits prices, DELETE removes, SELECT checks stock.\n\n**Practice Question 3:** Insert a new employee (ID 4, 'David Kim', 70000.00, 'IT'). Then update David's salary to 72000.00 and delete Bob's row. Show the final table with SELECT.\nSolution:\n- Explanation: INSERT adds a row; UPDATE changes column values in a row; DELETE removes a row; SELECT views.\n- Queries:\n  ```sql\n  INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (4, 'David Kim', 70000.00, 'IT');\n  UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 72000.00 WHERE ID = 4;  -- Assuming ID targets David\n  DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 2;\n  SELECT * FROM Employees;\n  ```\n- Final Result:\n  | ID | Name       | Salary   | Department |\n  |----|------------|----------|------------|\n  | 1  | Alice Smith| 58000.00 | Sales      |\n  | 4  | David Kim  | 72000.00 | IT         |\n\n#### 4.

Rationale: This creates quantifiable metrics for the MLOps loop, enabling data-driven updates to core instructions rather than vague suggestions, boosting system reliability.\n\n3. **Incorporate Versioning for Core Instructions**: Track changes to the core instructions with version numbers and changelog summaries in responses. Rationale: In an MLOps context, this ensures traceability, allows rollback if issues arise, and helps users understand evolutions, promoting transparency and trust.\n\n4. **Add Error Handling for Edge Cases**: Include fallback mechanisms, such as default prompts for ambiguous inputs or alerts for policy violations (e.g., jailbreak attempts). Rationale: This makes the system more resilient, adhering to safety policies while maintaining helpfulness, and provides learning data for MLOps refinements.\n\n5. **Optimize for Scalability with Batch Processing**: Support batch inputs for multiple questions in one session, with aggregated feedback. Rationale: As usage grows, this improves efficiency, reduces LLM API costs, and enriches the MLOps dataset for broader instruction improvements.\n\n### Overall Recommendation\nImplement these via a modular update to the core instructions, starting with input validation and feedback standardization for quick wins. Pilot test with user simulations to measure impact on prompt quality and response accuracy before full rollout.\n</FINAL_RESPONSE>",
