        "final_response": "Task: Provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of the largest planet in our solar system, including its key characteristics, size comparison to other planets, and notable features.\n\nOutput Format: Start with a brief introductory paragraph explaining what the planet is and why it's the largest. Follow with 5-7 bullet points highlighting essential facts such as diameter, mass, composition, moons, and exploration history. End with a short concluding sentence on its significance.\n\nConstraints: Base all information on verified astronomical data from sources like NASA. Keep the language simple, engaging, and suitable for a general audience (ages 12+). Limit the total response to under 300 words. Do not include unrelated topics or speculation; focus solely on factual details. Ensure the response is positive and inspiring about space exploration.\n</OPTIMIZED_PROMPT>\n\n<FINAL_RESPONSE>\nJupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant that dwarfs all others in size and mass, making it a fascinating subject for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.\n\n- **Size and Scale**: Jupiter has a diameter of about 88,846 miles (142,984 kilometers) at its equator, roughly 11 times that of Earth\u2014over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it.\n- **Mass**: It is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, with a mass of 1.898 \u00d7 10^27 kilograms, contributing significantly to the solar system's overall gravity.\n- **Composition**: Primarily made of hydrogen (90%) and helium (10%), similar to the Sun, with swirling clouds of ammonia and water vapor creating its colorful bands.\n- **Great Red Spot**: This iconic storm, larger than Earth, has raged for at least 400 years and is a hallmark of Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere.\n- **Moons**: Jupiter boasts 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014discovered by Galileo in 1610.\n- **Rings**: It has a faint ring system made of dust particles, discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979.\n- **Exploration**: Pioneered by missions like Pioneer 10 (1973), Voyager (1979), and Juno (2016-present), which revealed its magnetic field and interior structure.\n\nJupiter's immense presence not only shapes our solar system but also inspires ongoing quests to uncover its secrets through future missions.\n</FINAL_RESPONSE>",

        "final_response": "<FINAL_RESPONSE>\nJupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant that's about 11 times wider than Earth and has a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined. It's mostly made of hydrogen and helium, with swirling clouds of ammonia and water ice creating its famous colorful bands and massive storms, including the Great Red Spot\u2014a storm bigger than Earth that's raged for centuries. Jupiter orbits the Sun every 12 Earth years and plays a key role in protecting inner planets by gravitationally pulling in asteroids and comets.\n\n- Jupiter has at least 95 moons, with the four largest (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) discovered by Galileo in 1610.\n- Its strong magnetic field creates auroras and intense radiation belts.\n- The planet's diameter is about 88,850 miles (143,000 km), making it visible to the naked eye from Earth.\n- NASA's Juno mission is currently studying Jupiter's atmosphere and interior up close.\n</FINAL_RESPONSE>",
